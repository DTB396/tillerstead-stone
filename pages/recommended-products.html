      <p class="lead">
        Every purchase through these links generates a small commission that directly funds:
      </p>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Free technical blog content covering ANSI standards, waterproofing systems, and material science</li>
        <li>Product guidance for homeowners (yes, we'll help you pick the right grout joint size)</li>
        <li>HTML development and hosting costs for this site</li>
        <li>Time spent answering questions—because renovating shouldn't feel like solving a puzzle blindfolded</li>

      <p>
        We don't run ads, we don't sell your email to vendors, and we don't gate content behind paywalls. 
        These affiliate commissions let us keep publishing detailed, no-BS technical content and offering product 
        guidance without turning the site into a lead-gen machine.

      <h2 id="faq-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Do I pay more when I use these links?</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          No. Amazon's prices are identical whether you use an affiliate link or search directly. 
          The commission comes from Amazon's marketing budget, not your wallet.
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Are these the exact products Tillerstead uses on jobs?</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Yes, with one caveat: We buy most materials through local supply houses (Floor & Decor, Tile Shop, 
          MSI) because we need them same-day. These Amazon links are for homeowners who want the same spec'd 
          products shipped to their door without needing a contractor account.
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Can I hire Tillerstead for my project?</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          We serve South Jersey (Atlantic, Cape May, Ocean counties) with a 4-8 week lead time for booked work. 
          <a href="/contact/">Contact us</a> for availability. If you're outside our service area, 
          use these product specs to vet your local contractor's material choices.
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>What if a product link is broken or out of stock?</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Amazon frequently changes product IDs. If a link doesn't work, search for the product name + brand directly on Amazon. 
          We update these links quarterly but can't catch every change in real-time.
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Do you recommend products from other retailers?</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Currently, only Amazon has an affiliate program that works for small independent contractors. 
          We're exploring partnerships with Floor & Decor and other specialty suppliers, but no commitments yet.
