      Tillerstead LLC is what happens when someone actually reads TCNA standards instead of winging it. 
      Licensed NJ tile contractor. Waterproof showers that pass flood tests. Documentation your insurance 
      company doesn't laugh at. The boring stuff that prevents $12,000 mold remediation bills.

      <h2 id="experience-heading">Why We're Annoying About Details</h2>
      <p>
        Tyler's the kind of contractor who measures substrate flatness with a level *and* a straightedge. 
        Who knows the difference between modified and non-modified thinset (and why your marble installer better know too). 
        Who's read ANSI A108.10 waterproofing specs and can explain why "some red paint" isn't a membrane system.
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes us slower than "some guy." It makes us more expensive than the Craigslist quote. 
        It also means your shower doesn't leak, your tile doesn't crack, and you're not Googling "mold remediation near me" in 18 months. 
        Trade-offs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Work includes occupied homes where we cover doorways and vacuum daily (revolutionary, we know), 
        rental properties where timelines actually matter, and coordination with GCs who appreciate contractors 
        who show up when scheduled and document everything.

      <h2 id="approach-heading">What Working Together Actually Looks Like</h2>
      <p>You've been ghosted by contractors. You've gotten the "yeah I can do that" from someone who definitely cannot. 
      You've lived through the "we'll be done Friday" that becomes "maybe next Thursday." Here's different:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Written everything:</strong> Scope, materials, timeline, payment terms, change-order process. In writing. Before work starts. Wild concept, right?</li>
        <li><strong>Daily photo logs:</strong> Substrate prep, waterproofing details, membrane corners, flood test results. So you know what's behind the tile before it's... behind the tile.</li>
        <li><strong>Texts returned same-day:</strong> Not "I'll call you back" that never happens. Not three-week reply gaps. Actual communication like professionals in 2024.</li>
        <li><strong>Realistic timelines:</strong> We say 2 weeks, it's 2 weeks. We don't say 3 days knowing it's 10. Shocking honesty.</li>
        <li><strong>Change orders in writing:</strong> Scope changes, prices adjust, you approve before work continues. No "surprise" invoices at closeout.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Is this revolutionary? No. Is it rare? Unfortunately.</p>

      <p>
        Tillerstead LLC holds New Jersey Home Improvement Contractor license <strong>HIC #{{ site.company.hic }}</strong>. 
        Based in Galloway Township, Atlantic County, because South Jersey humidity is its own character-building experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Service area:</strong> Atlantic, Ocean, and Cape May Counties (where we know which tile suppliers stock what, 
        which inspectors care about what, and which Shore towns flood during nor'easters).<br>
        Larger projects statewide considered—we'll just charge you for the Parkway tolls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Work follows NJ building codes (2018 IBC/IRC), TCNA Handbook standards (2024 edition with the annoying new 95% thinset coverage requirement), 
        and ANSI A118.10 waterproofing specs (because "waterproof" is a technical term, not a feeling).
      </p>
      <p>
        Insurance certificates available on request. References provided (with permission from past clients who aren't sick of us yet).
      </p>
      <p class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Pro tip:</strong> If your contractor quote doesn't list an HIC number, they're either unlicensed 
        or hoping you don't ask. Ask.
