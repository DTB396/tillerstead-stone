    <h2>Property Maintenance</h2>

      Recurring service plans for routine upkeep, small repairs, and scheduled inspections.
      Maintenance plans include visit logs and priority scheduling.

    <ul class="service-list">
      <li><strong>Seasonal inspections:</strong> Regular walkthroughs to spot issues early and address them before they turn into costly repairs.</li>
      <li><strong>Minor repairs:</strong> Fixture swaps, door and cabinet adjustments, hardware updates, and light carpentry work.</li>
      <li><strong>Grout and caulk refresh:</strong> Preventive maintenance in kitchens, bathrooms, and wet areas to help prevent leaks and damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Paint touch-ups:</strong> Wall, trim, and door touch-ups to keep spaces looking clean between larger projects.</li>
      <li><strong>Priority scheduling:</strong> Maintenance plan clients receive faster response times and easier access to the schedule.</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Photo logs and service notes for each visit so you know exactly what was completed.</li>

    <h2>Bathroom & Kitchen Remodeling (Tile-Adjacent Services)</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Complete bathroom and kitchen updates coordinated with tile work. Written scopes that actually match reality. 
      Change orders documented *before* work proceeds (not surprised invoices at closeout). 
      The kind of project management your last contractor promised but didn't deliver.
    </p>
    <ul class="service-list">
      <li><strong>Bathroom remodels:</strong> Layout planning that accommodates plumbing realities. Coordination with plumbers and electricians (who we'll actually schedule, not "I'll call my guy"). Tile work, vanity installation, fixture placement, and waterproofing details done in logical sequence. Exhaust fan sizing for actual moisture load (not the cheapest one that fits).</li>
      <li><strong>Kitchen backsplashes & floors:</strong> Coordination with cabinet and countertop installers (scheduled in the correct order, imagine that). Outlet placement that makes sense for appliances. Tile behind stoves that survives heat cycling. Transitions to adjacent rooms that don't look like an afterthought.</li>
      <li><strong>Flooring beyond tile:</strong> LVP, engineered hardwood, and other hard surfaces where tile doesn't make sense. Proper substrate prep (still important even when it's not tile). Transitions done correctly. Underlayment selection for sound/moisture concerns.</li>
      <li><strong>The finish carpentry:</strong> Baseboards that hide tile edges. Crown where appropriate (not everywhere—less is often more). Built-ins for functional storage. Trim work that looks intentional, not "ran out of money" incomplete.</li>
      <li><strong>Drywall & paint:</strong> Patching, skim coating, and repainting targeted areas or full rooms. Matching existing texture (the annoying kind). Accent walls where they make sense. Two coats because one coat looks like one coat.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Tile Installation Section -->
  <div class="service-section" id="tile">
    <h2>Tile Installation & Waterproofing (The Part That Matters Most)</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Here's the thing about tile: it's not hard to stick to a wall. Kindergarten craft projects prove this daily. 
      What's hard is building waterproof assemblies that survive South Jersey humidity, substrate movement, and thermal cycling. 
      ANSI A118.10 waterproofing. TCNA-compliant substrate prep. ISO 13007 C2-rated thinset for large-format. 
      The boring specs that prevent exciting insurance claims.
    </p>
    <ul class="service-list">
      <li><strong>Waterproof showers that don't leak:</strong> Schluter KERDI, Hydroban, or RedGard membranes (not "red paint from the box store"). Installed to manufacturer specs. Flood tested before tile with photos you can show skeptical spouses. Proper slope (1/4" per foot), pre-pitch where required, and seam details done correctly the first time.</li>
      <li><strong>Large-format tile (24×48 and up):</strong> Substrate flatness verified (1/8" in 10'), not assumed. C2-rated modified thinset (because TCNA says so). Back-buttering on tiles >24". Lippage control systems on every install. The stuff that separates "installed" from "done right."</li>
      <li><strong>Backsplashes worth photographing:</strong> Outlet cutouts that don't look like someone sneezed. Clean terminations at cabinets. Caulked transitions (not grouted—wrong tool for the job). Layout that makes sense from where you actually stand, not what's easiest.</li>
      <li><strong>Floor tile that survives:</strong> Uncoupling membranes where deflection is a concern (wood subfloors, we're looking at you). Movement joints at perimeter and plane changes. Proper thinset coverage so you don't hear hollow sounds when walking. Grout sealed with penetrating sealer, not that glossy garbage that peels.</li>
      <li><strong>Heated floors that heat:</strong> Schluter DITRA-HEAT, SunTouch, or NuHeat mats with actual programmable thermostats (not the $12 dial kind). GFCI protection because electrical codes exist for reasons. Ohm testing before, during, and after to prove it works before we cover it in tile.</li>
      <li><strong>Shower niche ninja:</strong> Prefab foam niches (Schluter, Wedi) or site-built with proper waterproofing and slope. No mystery leaks five years later. No "why is there mold in the wall" phone calls.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Monthly Plans Module -->
  <aside class="plans-module" aria-labelledby="plans-heading">
    <h2 id="plans-heading">Monthly Maintenance Plans (The "House Babysitting" Service)</h2>
    <p>
      You know what's cheaper than emergency repairs? Catching problems early. Monthly maintenance plans give you \n      a licensed contractor who actually shows up, handles the small annoying stuff, and spots the "this will be \n      $8,000 if we ignore it" issues before they become $8,000 issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      Good fit for: Homeowners who travel. Landlords with multiple properties. People who bought old Shore houses \n      and learned about "deferred maintenance" the expensive way. Anyone tired of chasing contractors for small jobs.

      <h3>How the Plans Work</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Initial walkthrough:</strong> We review the property together, note recurring concerns, and agree on a realistic scope for the plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduled visits:</strong> Visits are set on a monthly or seasonal rhythm, with clear windows for arrival and a defined list of tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> After each visit, you receive notes and photos summarizing what was inspected, repaired, or recommended.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> If we find issues outside the scope of the plan, you’ll get straightforward recommendations and, where appropriate, referrals to licensed specialists.</li>

    <div class="plans-scope">
      <h3>Scope &amp; Limitations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plans focus on routine upkeep, minor repairs, and visual checks. They are not emergency services or full code-compliance inspections.</li>
        <li>Major plumbing, electrical, HVAC, roofing, structural work, or life-safety issues are referred to appropriate licensed trades.</li>
        <li>Some tasks may depend on safe access, weather, and site conditions and may be rescheduled if needed.</li>
        <li>Materials and third-party costs are either client-supplied or billed as agreed in writing before work is performed.</li>
        <li>All work is performed under a written service agreement and/or individual work orders that define final scope, pricing, and responsibilities.</li>
