        Process for working with general contractors:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Estimates:</strong> Send plans or takeoffs. Written proposal includes scope, substrate requirements, waterproofing details, and material allowances.</li>

        <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Target dates confirmed in writing with readiness checklist. Reminders sent one week and one day before mobilization.</li>

        <li><strong>Change Orders:</strong> Any scope adjustments are documented the day they surface, with clear pricing and written approval so billing tracks the actual work performed.</li>

        <li><strong>Punchlists:</strong> Work finishes with photo documentation, cleanup, and a signed completion report to make your closeout straightforward.</li>
